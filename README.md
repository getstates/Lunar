# What is Lunar?
Lunar is a script hub, almost available for current popular new games.\
We find vulnerabilites in these games and puts it in our script for people to use.\
**Should we report it? Yes, but no**\
Why you may ask? Well, these vulnerabilites that is used in our script is to raise awareness.\
So these developers doesn't just make cash-grabs games.\
**Remember, we only find and use the vulnerabilites on cash-grabs games. Not other games that is not p2w.**
