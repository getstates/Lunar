# Hello everybody.
I've lost all my motivation on creating script for games like Brookhaven and BGSI.\
I will continue with a whole different game, such as Grow A Garden, and so much more.\
For now, i'll say goodbye to this script and to all of you guys. Maybe i will comeback soon. But not now :)
# What will happend in the future?
As i stated before, this script hub will be reworked.
# What de-motivates me from making script for RP/Clicker games?
Its really not that much, what demotivates me from updating my script is the owner patching everything.\
Every bugs, exploits, and bypasses i've found for the game, its all patched within 2-3 weeks/months.\
Its really sad and demotivating that everything in my script get patched at one
# Final message to all of you guys
Thanks for using my scripts, even though its not fully done some of you guys use it.\
Its really fun seeing you guys using my scripts at different games.

Goodbye.
